For SNU/2D/Programming Tools/IDE/ReStructuredText
-----------------

The project language file for this project is ReStructuredText, as this project (SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_ReStructuredText) focuses directly on ReStructuredText.

This is the first time I am using ReStructuredText as a project language file, as yesterday I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) and I expanded it to other languages, YAML, and now ReStructuredText. if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your ``.gitattributes`` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but ``.gitattributes``)

.. code:: gitattributes

.. :: *.md linguist-detectable=true

.. :: *.md linguist-documentation=false

``*.rst linguist-detectable=true``

``*.rst linguist-documentation=false``
